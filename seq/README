This directory contains the code to construct simulators for SEQ,
SEQ+, and the variants of it described in the homework exercises.

**************************
1. Building the simulators
**************************

The simulators run in TTY mode:

TTY mode: A simulator running in TTY mode prints all information
about its runtime behavior on the terminal.  It's hard to understand what's
going on, but useful for automated testing, and doesn't require any
special installation features.

Once you've configured the Makefile, you can build the different
simulators with commands of the form

unix> make clean; make

***********************
2. Using the simulators
***********************

The simulators take identical command line arguments:

Usage: ssim [-hi] [-l m] [-v n] file.yo

   -h     Print this message
   -l m   Set instruction limit to m [non interactive mode only] (default 10000)
   -v n   Set verbosity level to 0 <= n <= 2 [non interactive mode only] (default 2)
   -i     Runs the simulator in interactive mode

When the simulator is run in non-interactive mode, its output is compared against yis.
